<h1>about us</h1>
<p> The Online Student's Grievance Redressal System is a new initiative taken by the University Grants Commission that facilitates 
students / complainants to lodge his or her grievance, send reminder and view status on action taken with regard to their grievance(s).
 The basic aim of the portal is to ensure transparency in admissions, prevent unfair practices in higher educational institutions and 
 provide a mechanism for redressal of their grievances.
The system also facilitates the universities to search and browse grievances lodged against their university and post action
 taken against the complaints on the portal as well as contact the complainant directly through e-mail, phone or by post.</p>
